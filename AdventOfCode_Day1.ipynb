More generally: if your list of numbers has length $n$, the algorithms makes $n$ sums for $n$ times. We technically say that the cost is $O(n^{2})$. Don't be scared by this!\n\nSo let's try to find some heuristics that can help to speed up the algorithm. First, it should be evident that we are repeating many times the same computation: for example, if the list contains only:\n\n- 1\n- 2\n- 3\n\nwe are doing the following:\n\n- Pick 1\n- sum 1 + 2, 1 + 3\n- then pick 2\n- sum 2 + 1, 2 + 3\n- then pick 3\n- sum 3 + 1, 3 + 2\n\nWhat a waste!

The reason is that algorithms are usually compared for $n$ approaching infinity, so it could be that they perform in the opposite direction for small numbers.\n\nCan we do better?\n\nWell, yes. When we design an algorithm we have (almost everytime) to consider the *worst case scenario* of the algorithm. In our previous algorithms, the worst case scenario was if the two correct numbers were the last two. In that case, the algorithm would have checked all the possible cases before getting to the right numbers! Even for the second algorithm, in the worst case scenario we would have computed $(n-1) + (n-2) + ... + 1$ sums. Why is this?\n\nThink with this example:\n\n- 1\n- 2\n- 3\n- 4\n- 5\n\nYou compute:\n(1+2), (1+3), (1+4), (1+5) (4 sums, that is 5-1)\n(2+3), (2+4), (2+5) (3 sums, 5-2)\n(3+4), (3+5), (2 sums, 5-3)\n(4+5) (1 sum)\n\nThere is a formula, called \"Gauss's formula\", to sum the first $n$ integers and it is:\n$$\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$$\n\nbut in our case we are summing numbers from 1 to $$n-1$$ so it becomes:\n$$\\frac{(n-1)n}{2} = \\frac{n^{2}-n}{2}$$.\n\nSo it is less than $n^{2}$, but still a big number!
